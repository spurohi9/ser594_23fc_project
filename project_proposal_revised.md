**Intellectual Merit:** The scientific discovery potential of this project lies in its ability to uncover key factors that drive anime popularity and track the evolution of genre preferences over time. By analyzing extensive datasets of anime attributes, ratings, and genres, the project aims to:

1. **Identify Key Success Factors:**

- Determine which attributes, such as genre, studio reputation, and release timing, most significantly influence an anime's popularity. This provides new insights into viewer engagement and success factors in media studies.

2. **Understand Genre Evolution:**

- Analyze historical trends to reveal shifts in genre popularity and how these trends correlate with cultural or societal changes. This offers a deeper understanding of evolving media consumption patterns.

By generating actionable knowledge from this analysis, the project will contribute to the fields of entertainment analytics and consumer behavior, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders.

**Data Sourcing:** The dataset for this project has been sourced from the MyAnimeList API via Jikan and is up to date as of October 18, 2024. It contains comprehensive details about each anime, including attributes such as Id, Name, Type, Source, Episodes, Airing status, Aired from/to dates, Duration, Rating, Score, Scored by, Rank, Popularity, Members, Favorites, Season, Year, Broadcast day/time, Producers, Licensors, Studios, Genres, and Themes.

The dataset spans various anime types (TV, Movie, OVA, ONA), offering a wide range of features for analysis. Transformations were applied to clean the data, such as standardizing dates, encoding categorical features, and ensuring numerical consistency. This dataset will provide the foundation for both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.
