**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing anime data to uncover insights about popularity and genre trends. By examining a rich dataset of anime titles, including attributes such as genre, studio, release year, and user ratings, we aim to answer key questions about what drives anime success and how genre preferences evolve over time.
Research Questions:

1. What factors most significantly influence the popularity of anime?

- Investigate whether specific genres, studios, or release seasons correlate with higher popularity and viewer engagement.

1. How have genre preferences shifted over time?

- Analyze historical data to determine trends in genre popularity and identify which genres are becoming more or less favored.

**Intellectual Merit:** The scientific discovery potential of this project lies in its ability to uncover key factors that drive anime popularity and track the evolution of genre preferences over time. By analyzing extensive datasets of anime attributes, ratings, and genres, the project aims to:

1. Identify Key Success Factors:

- Determine which attributes, such as genre, studio reputation, and release timing, most significantly influence an anime's popularity. This provides new insights into viewer engagement and success factors in media studies.

1. Understand Genre Evolution:

- Analyze historical trends to reveal shifts in genre popularity and how these trends correlate with cultural or societal changes. This offers a deeper understanding of evolving media consumption patterns.
  By generating actionable knowledge from this analysis, the project will contribute to the fields of entertainment analytics and consumer behavior, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders.

**Data Sourcing:** Methodology for Retrieving Data:

- APIs: Utilize reliable APIs such as MyAnimeList (MAL) API, AniList API, or Jikan API to gather detailed anime data. These APIs provide comprehensive information on anime titles, genres, ratings, studios, and release years.
- Web Scraping (if necessary): For additional or supplementary data not available through APIs, use web scraping techniques on trusted anime databases like MyAnimeList or Anime-Planet.
