These APIs provide comprehensive information on anime titles, genres, ratings, studios, and release years.
- **Web Scraping (if necessary):** For additional or supplementary data not available through APIs, use web scraping techniques on trusted anime databases like [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) or [Anime-Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/).
