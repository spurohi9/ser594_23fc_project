Explanation: The model classifies Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as popular due to its high-quality source material (Manga), a substantial number of episodes (64), favorable R rating, and release during a prime Spring season in 2009. The involvement of reputable studios like Bones and major licensors such as Aniplex further contribute to its widespread appeal.

37823 Conception Conception TV Game 12 FALSE 2018-10-10 00:00:00+00:00 2018-12-26 00:00:00+00:00 23 PG-13 - Teens 13 or older 4.58 52737 13370.0 1792 129987 170 fall 2018 Wednesdays 01:30 ['Sotsu'] ['Funimation'] ['Gonzo'] ['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'] ['Harem', 'Isekai', 'Parody']

Prediction Explanation:
Prediction: Unpopular
Explanation: Conception is unpopular because of the limited episode count (12), a Game as its source, and PG-13 rating, meaning smaller depth of content. Its release in the Fall season of 2018 with less recognized licensors and also niche themes such as Harem and Parody indicates poor audience engagement and appeal.

## Interesting Features

### Feature A

**Feature:** Source

**Justification:** The origin of any anime-Manga, Light Novel, or Game-often determines the depth in storytelling and what audiences would come to expect. For example, anime that originates from popular manga usually has a strong following and more developed storylines, which increases their popularity. However, anime that stems from games may attract audiences from a very specific niche, which can have an impact on their wider popularity.

### Feature B

**Feature:** Studios

**Justification:** The quality of the anime and its reception depend a lot on the studio producing it. Famous studios like Bones or Madhouse are well known for their great animation, storytelling, and flow, and often captivate viewership and popularity. Less popular or low-tier studios may make anime that sometimes has inconsistent quality; therefore, the audience is less interested in viewing.
