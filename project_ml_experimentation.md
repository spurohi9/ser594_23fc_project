Prediction Explanation:
Prediction: Unpopular
Explanation: Conception is unpopular because of the limited episode count (12), a Game as its source, and PG-13 rating, meaning smaller depth of content. Its release in the Fall season of 2018 with less recognized licensors and also niche themes such as Harem and Parody indicates poor audience engagement and appeal.
